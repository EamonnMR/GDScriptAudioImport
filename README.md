# GDScriptAudioImport
A script in GDScript for importing .wav and .ogg audio files at runtime

I'm sure there's way more efficient ways to do this, but for me this works so far and it's my little baby.

TODO:
1. Create a light version with only what is needed to set the AudioStreamSample
2. Complete the "full version" - Keep it big for learning/referencing purposes
3. Make it as a script Plugin
4. Look for more efficient ways to parse the data and update it.
5. Hope Godot Community and devs include a .wav importer at runtime that works at least as fine as the .og importer
